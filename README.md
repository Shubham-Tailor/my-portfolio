# My Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, created using **Next.js**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**. The website showcases my skills, work experience, and projects in a visually appealing and interactive way.

## Features

- **Interactive Navigation**: The navigation menu slides in from the left and highlights the current section.
- **Blob Effect**: A glowing blob follows the mouse cursor for a dynamic visual effect.
- **Text Hover Effect**: Titles change into random characters before revealing the actual text upon hover.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be fully responsive and looks great on all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications and static websites.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs quickly.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
- **jQuery**: A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library (used for animation).
- **Velocity.js**: A fast JavaScript animation engine for UI transitions.
